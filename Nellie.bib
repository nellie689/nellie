	abstract = {Registration-based atlas building often poses computational challenges in high-dimensional image spaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid atlas building algorithm that fast estimates atlas from large-scale image datasets with much reduced computational cost. In contrast to previous approaches that iteratively perform registration tasks between an estimated atlas and individual images, we propose to use learned priors of registration from pre-trained neural networks. This newly developed hybrid framework features several advantages of (i) providing an efficient way of atlas building without losing the quality of results, and (ii) offering flexibility in utilizing a wide variety of deep learning based registration methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed model on 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.},
